## Submitting a Pull Request

You do not need to use the command line, but I have included the commands in case you'd prefer that route.

I used Kelly's branch in the examples below.

0. No need to **Fork** it since we're all members of the 240ZorkGroup group.
0. Create a **branch** (`git checkout -b Kelly`). I've already made 3 individual branches for each of us. Just select yours from the pull-down menu towards the left of the column. 
0. Make your **changes**.
0. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -am "Updated CONTRIBUTING.md file"`)
0. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin Kelly`)
0. Open a **Pull Request**. Ensure it says "base:**master** ... compare:**Kelly**" and "Able to merge" is green with a check mark. Enter your merge comments and click the green button "Create pull request". This is a request for the 240ZorkGroup to reach down and *pull* those changes into our main project.
0. Wait (or since we are all admins for the group, **Merge** the pull request yourself _**in the 240ZorkGroup**_).
