**Verbose Mode** +2 - From example list.<br>
**Hunger** +5 - From example list. <br>
**Thirst** +5 - Similar to hunger. Thirst will diminish by 2 points per turn. We believe that it is worth that same amount of points as hunger. <br>
**External CLock** +5 - From example List.<br>
**Closed & Locked Exits** +15 - We are going to have one door that is locked with treasure behind it. In order to unlock this door they must posses the master key, which they will get by doing a series of events using specific items that reveal the master key. For example, they will put a quarter into a vending machine, dirnk the can that comes out, recylce that can, and then the master key will be revealed. We believe that is worth 15 points because it is different but also doing the same things as the closed/locked exits in the example list. <br>
**NPC's (non-player characters)** +20 - This will do everything from the example list, not including the dialogue for extra points. <br>
<br>
**Total points for supplementary list** = 52 points. <br>
