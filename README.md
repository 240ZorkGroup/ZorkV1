# Zork v1

### Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games. 

This version of Zork is set in Trinkle Hall, a building at University of Mary Washington. The player is a nameless adventurer "who is venturing into this dangerous land in search of wealth and adventure". The goal is to return from exploring the Trinkle Hall alive and with all treasures needed to complete each adventure, ultimately inheriting the title of Dungeon Master. The dungeon is stocked with items, locations, money, and the light-fearing Grue.

In each game, there are several light sources the player can pick up and use, among them are a battery-powered flashlight and a lightsaber, which both have a limited lifespan, as well as a flame-torch that never expires. The player must be carrying at least one light source at all times when exploring the dark areas of the games, or else, if he or she continues navigating through the dark, the player will be caught and devoured by a carnivorous grue, ending the adventure in defeat. The exception to this rule occurs when the player must use a spray can of grue repellent to navigate dark areas requiring an empty inventory in order to traverse.

The ultimate goal of Zork v1 is to collect the 6 Treasures of Zork and install them in the trophy case. Finding the treasures might require solving a variety of puzzles, such as the a mathematical problem that will open a trunk. Placing all of the treasures into the trophy case scores the player 300 points and grants the rank of "Master Adventurer." The door upstairs in the Rotunda unlocks and the player wins when they leave the Rotunda to go outside.
