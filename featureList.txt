Light - Some rooms, not all, will be completely dark to the adventurer unless
        he/she has a light source (torch, spylaser, lightsaber, whatever) available and turned
        on. Light sources must be items that are discoverable in the dungeon and which
        "defuel" over time; i.e. there must be a finite length to how long they last before
        burning out. You can test Light in supplemental.txt by picking up the torch in the Rotunda,

                 experience. A simple example of this is time of day: as the user plays the dungeon,
                 time will cycle from day to night and back again at an appropriate pace. Randomized
                 weather events would be another colorful choice. .To test this in supplemental.txt,
                 play about 4-5 turns and when it changes time of day you get a notice.

Closed and Locked Exits - Some exits can be in a closed or locked state. To test this in supplementary.bork
                          if you go down to the Basement hallway then south to room B13 you will get locked
                          in with a bomb!! Also if you take the wand from the Rotunda Balcony then you
                          can escape this laocked room by using to transport yourself to a random room.

NPC/TicTacToe - There are other creatures in the dungeon besides just the adventurer. These creatures
                have their own position, state, inventory, health, and possibly other attributes, and
                the player can only interact with them when they encounter each other. To test this
                using supplementary.txt, you can go down to the Basement hallway, then east to room B6.
                If you type "speak to Grue" then you can interact with him. He will ask you to play a
                game of TicTacToe. If you win you get 100 points added to your score.
